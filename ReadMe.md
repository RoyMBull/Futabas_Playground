# Futaba's Playground

This is a custom CTF challenge that I wrote and scripted myself.

# How to Play?:

This is intended to be run as a server on another system, but you are also free to play it on your main system as well (I don't recommend this as you can install and do whatever as root which can ruin the whole challenge for you)

Much like how hackthebox does things you are free to look at a good chunk of the files and any if you “happen” to have access to them ;) This doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to complete all the challenges and secure all the flags for completion as I thought of ways to hide or secure the advanced ones further.
