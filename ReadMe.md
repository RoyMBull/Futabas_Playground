# Futaba's Playground

This is a custom CTF challenge that I wrote and scripted myself in HTML/CSS/JS and PHP.
If you wish to enjoy the main CTF challenge I advise for you to
  -> Keep the challenge location hidden from the participant (THIS REPOSITORY)
  -> Use this only on an ubuntu apache2 server in order to truly make RCE parts of the challenge a lot harder to pull off
  -> The script is also going to remove the main configuration file in here after it's done setting up and replace the executable to prevent attackers from
  	stealing the source code which contains all the credentials, spoiling the challenge.
