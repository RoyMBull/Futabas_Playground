# Futaba's Playground (DEBIAN ONLY)

This is a custom portable CTF server that I wrote in: HTML/CSS/JS, and PHP. Further languages used are SQL for the backend of the database which is MYSQL. The server is designed to allow you to pentest wherever you are locally vs the traditional means of having to be connected to the internet in order to engage in web application pentesting CTF challenges, allowing you to get practice wherever you are on the go. It’s also home lab friendly and allows you to practice network penetration testing as well, and includes a variety of challenges that test a lot of your hacking methodology and skill sets. You’re going to have to apply yourself and LEARN if you want to secure all “**11 flags**”.

You can run this challenge as either locally on your system, or on another system that you can run either directly or vm machine. This makes it more accessible to all users. 
If you have nethunter you can also participate in the challenge as well from you phone if you wanted to try mobile hacking.  

**THIS DOES RUN ON NETHUNTER AS WELL THE SAME WAY. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE ROOT WHEN YOU RUN NETHUNTER SO THE SCRIPT WORKS CORRECTLY OTHERWISE IT WILL CRASH AND FAIL!**

# How to play? 

**This is intended to be ran as a server side setup on another system. To prevent cheating I also configured it to be able to run on your main local system with high Security in place.**

-> Run the command “chmod +rwx” on the “mysqlconfig.sh.x”
-> Next run the command “./mysqlconfig.sh.x” and this will run the main configurations 

# How to restore your system back to normal? MAJOR WARNING! 

Due to the overall nature of how it mods your system, I've installed fallback mechanics that can repiar your entire system if need be. **This is explained to you when you run my script**

-> Run the command “cd /home/CTF/” and this will bring you to the directory that is holding all the same files that you originally downloaded. 
-> Run the command “chmod +rwx” on the “mysqlconfig.sh.x”
-> Next run the command “./mysqlconfig.sh.x” and this will run the main configurations to repiar your system

# Final Flag Hint

There IS, one more flag that you can find, and it's a special one. Rewards for this are still in progress, but there is something that I plan on working on in case you find it. 

It is possible to find this flag early unlocking "**Express Mode"**, allowing you to clear 6 of the main flags in one go, including the one you just found so that you can just do the last ones which are hard in and of itself. I still recommend even if you find this one that you put in the time to solve them legit as it's vital for your growth as a hacker! 

HINT:
